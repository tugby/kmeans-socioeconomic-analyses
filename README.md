# Socio-Economic Indicators and Violence Crimes: K-Means Clustering Analysis

This project applies K-means clustering to socio-economic indicators and violence-related crime data in order to explore similarities between European countries.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Correlation analysis
- K-means clustering
- Elbow method (WSS)
- Silhouette analysis
