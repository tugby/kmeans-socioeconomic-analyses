# Socio-Economic Indicators and Violence Crimes: K-Means Clustering Analysis

This project applies K-means clustering to socio-economic indicators and violence-related crime data in order to explore similarities between European countries.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Correlation analysis
- K-means clustering
- Elbow method (WSS)
- Silhouette analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- **R** – Data analysis and statistical computing  
- **RStudio** – Integrated development environment (IDE)  
- **readxl** – Reading Excel files  
- **ggcorrplot** – Correlation matrix visualization  
- **car** – Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis  
- **cluster** – Clustering algorithms and silhouette analysis  
- **factoextra** – Visualization of clustering results  
- **tidyverse** – Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **caret** – Data preprocessing utilities

## Data Source
The dataset used in this study was obtained from the World Bank Open Data platform and includes socio-economic indicators related to European countries.

## Contribution
This project was completed as a group assignment. I was responsible for the K-means clustering analysis, including model selection, visualization, and interpretation.
